My first game using Babylon JS.

A lot of things have to be done in the way of learning Babylon JS : 
Awaking my Javascript knowledge to ES6 and TypeScript (not for this one)
  * Discover Babylon JS functions and "logic"
  * Keep things simple
  * Have fun

Like usual when discovering game libraries like Babylon JS (it's not limited to games) nothing is like coding classics : Breakout, Pong, PacMan and so on.

## Instructions

1. Open a terminal and go to your projects directory
   
Exemple : `cd myprojects`



3. Clone this repository 

`git clone https://github.com/pigmin/Breakout.git`



4. Go to the local repository directory

`cd Breakout`



5. Install dependencies with Node Package Manager

`npm install`



6. Test the game

`npm start`
