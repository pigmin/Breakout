My first game using Babylon JS.

A lot of things have to be done in the way of learning Babylon JS : 
Awaking my Javascript knowledge to ES6 and TypeScript (not for this one)
  * Discover Babylon JS functions and "logic"
  * Keep things simple
  * Have fun

Like usual when discovering game libraries like Babylon JS (it's not limited to games) nothing is like coding classics : Breackout, Pong, PacMan and so on.
